  { question: "Can you support remote and hybrid teams?", answer: "Yes. We support remote workstations, user access, cloud environments, and day-to-day IT issues for teams working across locations." },
  { question: "What happens to our existing IT team?", answer: "We can work alongside your team, take care of a defined service area, or manage day-to-day support. We agree responsibilities and escalation paths before work begins." },
  { question: "Which tools can you work with?", answer: "Our team works with Microsoft Intune, CrowdStrike, Tenable, Qualys, ServiceNow, AWS, and Azure. We can also work with the tools already in your environment." },
  { question: "Do you offer long-term support agreements?", answer: "Yes. A maintenance agreement can be useful once we understand your environment and have built a working support process together. It is an option, not a requirement." },
